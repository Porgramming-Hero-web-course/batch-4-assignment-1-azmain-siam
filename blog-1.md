The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript  
In TypeScript, union and intersection types enhance flexibility and safety in code.

Union Types: Flexibility with Multiple Types  
A union type allows a variable to be one of several types, making it adaptable while maintaining type safety.

Example

```typescript
let id: number | string;
id = 123;    // OK
id = "abc";  // OK
```

Union types are useful for functions that handle multiple input types:

```typescript
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + (typeof id === "string" ? id.toUpperCase() : id));
}

printId(101);      // Output: Your ID is 101
printId("abc");    // Output: Your ID is ABC
```

Why It Matters: Union types reduce redundancy, allowing a single function or variable to handle different types.

Intersection Types: Combining Multiple Types  
An intersection type merges multiple types, requiring that all properties are present.

Example

```typescript
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeId: number };
type Staff = Person & Employee;

const staffMember: Staff = { name: "Alice", employeeId: 123 };
```

Intersection types are ideal for creating complex types that combine multiple structures.

Why It Matters: Intersection types help structure complex data and avoid redundancy by merging properties from different types.

Real-World Application  
Union types are useful for handling flexible data (e.g., API responses with success/error cases). Intersection types are helpful when creating specific structures, like combining user and admin properties.

Using union and intersection types makes TypeScript code more versatile, maintainable, and type-safe.
